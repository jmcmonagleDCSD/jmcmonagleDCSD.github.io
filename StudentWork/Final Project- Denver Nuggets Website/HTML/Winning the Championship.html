            Winning the Championship
        </h1>

        <h3 class="maintext"> 
            The Denver Nuggets, after decades of waiting for the perfect set of players, finally win their well-deserved championship.
            Nikola Jokic, the player to give hope.
            Jokic was a lower level pick in the draft, but the Nuggets soon saw that his potential was unreal.
            Jokic was the first one to start the Denver Nuggets line to glory.
            Jamal Murray was a guaranteed starter player. 
            The Nuggets knew that Jamal was going to be amazing from the start, he was a first pick in the draft.
            The other starters were acquired along the way, all of them amazing players.
            The Nuggets were so close to winning it all, but then Jamal endured a year and a half long injury.
            This set the team back by year, desperate to win.
            When Murray came back, the Nuggets knew that they had it in the bag.
            They were going to win the championship.
