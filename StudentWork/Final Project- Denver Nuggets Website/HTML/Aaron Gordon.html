        <p class="maininfo">
            Gordon is all-star level. 
            Without him, the Denver Nuggets would not be the amazing team that they are.
            The Nuggets acquired Aaron Gordon in a trade with the Orlando Magic, another NBA team.
            Aaron is not only a good player, but his style is just cool.
            He recently signed with a shoe company, and now has his own shoes.
            The new AG 361's are nice shoes, and just add to his style.
        </p>

        <p class="goldenline">
            Most Denver Nuggets fans know that Gordon is a key part of the team's scheme to create a dynasty.
