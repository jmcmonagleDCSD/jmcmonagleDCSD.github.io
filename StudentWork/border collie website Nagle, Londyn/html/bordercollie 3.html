        <h3>there are two types of fur</h3>
        <p>theres rough which is the more common coat and is also the longer coat of the two</p>
        <p>then theres smooth which is more uncommon and has the short hair</p>
        <p>in my opinion the rough is the better of the two but they are both really cute</p>
