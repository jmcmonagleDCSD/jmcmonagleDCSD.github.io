        <h1>Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)</h1>
        <p>Pothos is one of the easiest houseplants to grow and is a beautiful addition to any home or office.</p> 
        <p>Best of all, pothos plants grow well in almost any situation! Native to Mo'orea, an island in French Polynesia,</p> 
        <p>pothos is a trailing vine with glossy or satiny, heart-shaped leaves.</p> 
        <H1>Pothos Care</H1>
        <P>Pothos plants like to dry out quite a bit between waterings. If you notice leaves yellowing or falling off, you may have waited too long.</P>
        <P>Dry, brown leaf edges also mean water more frequently.</P>
        <p>Be sure to drench the plant thoroughly each time you water (until water runs out of the drainage holes in the pot) and then let it dry before watering again.</P>
        <p>Make sure to water you pothos every 1-2 week and make sure to let the soil dry out between watering</p>
        <p> Pothos are toxic to both dogs and cats</p>
        <p>Pothos also help purify the air and they remove the folloing toxins:formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene.</p>
