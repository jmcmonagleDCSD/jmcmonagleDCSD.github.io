        <h2>What are Bears, and What do They do?</h2>
        <p>Bears are NPC's (Non-Player Characters) That are located across the mountain that is the Bee Swarm Map. The first bear that you will encounter is going to be black bear (Located Below). Bears will give you quests, which involve you going across the Bee Swarm map and completing various tasks. The most of the time involve getting pollen from different feilds or different color flowers.</p>

            <h1>Mother Bear</h1>
            <p>Motherbear will be located at the top of sunflower feild. She gives one questline, and all of the quests include feeding bees and leveling them up. At the end of the questline, mother bear will give you a star treat. You can give this star treat to any of your bees. I would prefer giving to one fo your event bees, since you can get gifted common, rares, epics, legendaries, and mythic bees ffrom star jellies and royal jellies. For the last quest of mother bear's, you must Raise a Bee to Level 10. Raise 5 Bees to Level 9. Raise 15 Bees to Level 8. Feed 10000 Treats to your Bees. Feed 250 Sunflower Seeds to your Bees.

Some of these include killing ants in the ant feild, or just mobs that respawn quickly like beetles or ladybugs. Completeing his questlines will gives star eggs, and his last quest, gives you a star treat. Again, if you feed a star treat to a bee, then it will automatically be gifted. To learn more about gifted bees, then go to the Bees page. This will teach you more about the bees in Bee Swarm.</p>
